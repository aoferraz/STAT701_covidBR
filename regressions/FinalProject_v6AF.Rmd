## The Covid problem in Brazil

Brazil confirmed its first case of Covid-19 in February 26,2020. As of now, almost 15 months after the outbreak, the country sees more 15M of cases and  more than 420,000 deaths. Since February, Brazil is the country with more daily new deaths per population and the third in terms of total cases, after the US and India.

**What are the reasons for such disaster in Brazil?**


## Structural facts about Brazil

Brazil is an emerging country with 211M (c.64% of US population), median age of 33.5 years (vs 38.4 in the US) and GDP per capita US$ 8,700 (c.13% of US), according to the 2019 numbers of the World Bank. The country is relatively young, populous and poor, compared to other nations which suffered greatly with Covid, so it is important to investigate what internal characteristics contributed for such devastating crisis.

From an internal perspective, the country is greatly diverse in terms of geography, population, economy, health system and political mindset.

**Geography**

- The country is the 5th largest in the world in terms of total area
- It has 26 states and 1 Federal District (where the capital Brasília is the only city located), so there are 27 territories part of the Federation
- Brazil is divided in 5 macro geographic regions: Southeast (SP, MG, RJ and ES), Northeast (BA, SE, AL, PB, PE, RN, CE, PI, MA), South (RS, PR< SC), North (PA, AM, AP, AC, RR, TO), and Midwest (GO, MT, MS and DF)
- There are 5570 counties, unevenly distributed across states. Minas Gerais (MG) and São Paulo (SP) have has more counties, 853 and 645 respectively, while Amapá (AP) and Roraima (RR) have only 16 and 15.

- The 211M inhabitants are concentrated on the coast, especially in regions Southeast (42% of total) and Northeast (27% of total)
- The state of São Paulo (SP) corresponds to 21% of Brazil's population, while its capital, São Paulo county, has 12.3M inhabitants (5.6% of total)
- North and Midwest have smaller populations despite the huge territories, leading to lower population densities
- There are 48.4% men and 51.6% woman
- 85% of the population live in urban areas
- Brazilian uses an ethnic and skin color self-declared methodology to classify races. There are approximately 46.8% pardos*, 42.7% white, 9.4% black, 1.1% Asian or Indigenous (native Amerindians)

*According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), 'pardos' represent a diverse range of skin colors and ethnic backgrounds with a skin tone darker than white and lighter than black, also be used for people from Asia with darker skin tones or other ethnicities with the same color

- GDP and income distribution in Brazil is highly unequal. According to the World Bank, Brazil is the 9th nation in terms of inequality
- The Southeast is richest region of Brazil, which translates into better income and education levels. São Paulo is the business center of the country and concentrates industry, services and consumption volumes
- The Midwest' economy is focused on the agriculture and livestock activities
- Northeast and North are poorer, presenting relevant part of population living in poverty or extreme poverty, and facing problems such as lack of access to cleaned water and sewage. Those regions have predominance of black and 'pardo' people, historically marginalized groups
- 50% of the economically active population is formally employed, so there is a relevant share of informal jobs and a currently high unemployment rate (14%), driven by the pandemic but mainly by political-economic downturn of 2014
- Almost 60% of the population receives direct or indirect support of the Federal Government through the 'Bolsa-Família' program, a social welfare program for poor families. Financial aid amount varies to the number of family profile, number and age of children

- Brazil has a universal publicly funded health care system (SUS), virtually covering the entire population, which makes it the largest in the world
- Considering its capillarity, amplitude and high demand, the system faces several challenges, such as the unequal coverage across regions, services downturn and long wait times
- Population with better income levels usually pays for private health plans.  Although only 23% of the population is covered by some type of private health insurance (rate which varies greatly across counties and regions), private expenditure with Health Care in Brazil corresponds to 58% of the total expenditure
- The country has a National Program for Immunization, public sponsored and offered, for children and adults. Before Covid, historically coverage has been high (more than 90%)

- Brazil is a federal presidential representative democratic republic, with 3 independent branches (executive, legislative and judicial) and three levels of administration (federal, state and municipalities)
- Presidential elections have direct votes, disputed by all candidates in the first round, and by the 2 most voted in the 2nd round (if the most voted candidate of the 1st round do not achieve 50% + 1 of valid votes)
- The last presidential election was in 2018, and the 2nd round was disputed by Jair Bolsonaro (right-wing candidate) and Fernando Haddad (left-wing candidate). Jair Bolsonaro was elected with 55.13% of valid votes in the 2nd round, after a very disturbed and polarized election process

[(The Guardian, April/21)](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/15/brazil-coronavirus-medecins-sans-frontieres-bolsonaro)

As a response for the catastrophic number of cases and deaths, there has been is an increasing criticism about the overall response of authorities, of different levels and sectors, to the crisis. The overall reaction was seen was late, limited, disorganized and disoriented.

From a general view, the coordination of lockdown and other social distancing measures was decentralized among states and counties, hindering the mapping and monitoring of initiatives taken.

Government expenditure with Covid is disclosed and can be analyzed at city level. The federal government also launched a Covid emergency financial aid, targeted to the more vulnerable people during the pandemic (low income, unemployed or informal, others). The program reached 1/3 the total population, costing 4% of the GDP.

From the health perspective, the main initiatives taken were the expansion of the assistance network (beds, equipment, staff) and the vaccine program (started on January 17, 2020)


## Goal of the study

This study seeks to investigate Brazil's structural factors and Covid-response related measures that can be associated with total Covid cases and deaths up to now (pandemic data used as of April 19, 2021).

Our project team compiled XXX different variables for each of the 5.5k counties in Brazil, after consolidating information of more than 80 databases, from 10 different data sources.

We performed multiple regression analysis, using LASSO regularization and Mallows' Cp statistics, to identify significant independent variables and develop a linear model associating cases and deaths to relevant factors.

With the model in hands, we can identify important factors of Covid death and cases, measure their potential impact and evaluate the performance of counties and states in terms of actual vs predicted results.


# Data and methodology

## Structure

The data used in the study is divided in 6 categories:

**1) Covid**

- Population by wage level
- Employment category
- Average working hours
- Employment evolution

## Methodology

The figure bellow represents the information flow, showing in high level how data was manipulated:

![Information flow](fig/information_flow.jpg)

The regression script formats the cleaned and joined data in order to perform the regression. Because of the huge number of independent variables, instead of running a full LASSO, we ran regressions within each category to screen variables, eliminate potential colinearities, remove variables with excessive NA or NaN values, pre-selecting variables for the full LASSO + fine tuning.

In the regressions, we forced the state name variables (27 levels) and used the Elbow rule to choose the optimal number of predictors when evaluating Cps. LASSO was run using forward selection and lambda.min.
